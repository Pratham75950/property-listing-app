## ðŸš€ How to Run the App

cd my-rental-app

npm install

npx json-server --watch db.json --port 3001


Make sure your Android emulator or device is on the same network and replace API URL with your local IP, currently in constant/index.ts to run in emulator uncomment the code.
http://10.0.2.2:3001

npm start
Press a to launch the app in Android emulator or npm run android .

ðŸ¤– Running on Android Emulator
Make sure Android Studio Emulator is open and running.

Use npm start (or npx expo start) and press a in the CLI.

If you face issues with API not fetching on emulator, try:

Use your local machine's IP address in API base URL (http://192.168.1.X:3001)

Avoid using localhost or 127.0.0.1 â€” those refer to the emulator itself, not your machine.

The app assumes a local development setup with a running JSON-server.
